# School District Analysis

## Overview of District Analysis
Maria is responsibly for analyzing information for City School System. She has been tasked with analyzing, reporting and presenting information on standardized testing data for the school system to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. 
We have been asked to help Maria analyze data on student funding and student's standardized math and reading scores.
Our goal is to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance in order to inform decisions around budgeting. In order to complete this we will produce the following deliverables:
-   A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
-   An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
-   Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
    -   Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
    -   The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
    -   The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
    -   School performance based on the budget per student
    -   School performance based on the school sizeÂ 
    -   School performance based on the type of school

During analysis evidence of academic misconduct was uncovered that suggested that reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders had been altered. As such we were asked to replaced all relevant scores with NaNs then repeat the analysis and provide a report on how removing these scores affected the overall analysis.
